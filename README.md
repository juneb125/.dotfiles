## Installation
**The Steps I Followed**

> [!WARNING]

1. I got started with [this Fireship YouTube tutorial](https://youtube.com/watch?v=r_MpUP6aKiQ) on starting your dotfiles journey
2. Then, I followed [this Dreams of Autonomy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud7YxC33Z3w) about further customization of `zsh`
3. Next, I set up Nix Packages (`nixpkgs`) as my package manager with [this amazing Dreams of Autonomy tutorial](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z8BL8mdzWHI)
4. I set up my text editor, NeoVim, by following [this amazing Typecraft YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn)

        <summary>my tips on how to learn Vim / NeoVim</summary>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>learn the basic Vim motions (how to move around a file and around a workspace), especially how to exit Vim :)</li>
            <li>turn on "Vim mode" in your current code editor</li>
            <li>when you feel comfortable with the motions, start using Vim (the regular Vim) in your terminal</li>
            <li>when you feel really comfortable using Vim in your terminal, download NeoVim if you want</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Learning Vim might seem super overwhelming, but if you practice consistently, you'll be amazing :)</p>
        <p>I believe in you! <3</p>
